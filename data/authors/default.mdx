Welcome to Quasilinear Musings! This blog serves as a playground for me to experiment
with ideas and share some of my findings. It's a reflection of my career path and
interests - especially on the technical side of things. For more information, check
out my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timlrx).

My main areas of interest includes quantitative research, socio-technological
change, open-source software and web technology. I try to combine them in my work in
various unique ways so expect to see more of these stuff in the future! This blog is bootstrapped from the awesome
[Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog Template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)
(coincidentally written by me). Source code for the website is available at my
[Github page](https://github.com/timlrx/timlrx.com).

On the open-source side of things, I am the developer of one of the most popular Next.js blog templates and a maintainer of [Contentlayer](https://github.com/timlrx/contentlayer2) as well as a variety of markdown plugins in the remark-rehype ecosystem. Other interesting side projects include a benchmark of graph analytics software and in-browser SQL WASM benchmark. My projects have accumulated more than 10k+ Github stars and I am in the list of top 100 Singapore OSS developers (by contributions / followers).
